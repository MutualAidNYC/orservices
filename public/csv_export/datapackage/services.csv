Native nations are swiftly being hit by the coronavirus; one of the communities this effort will serve, the Navajo Nation, has a higher infection rate per capita than any state other than NY and NJ. The infection and death rate on the Navajo Nation alone is 10 times higher than the state of Arizona, despite the fact that the tribe reported its first case of Coronavirus 51 days after Arizona. This scenario is playing out all across Indian Country. 
 
The Coronavirus is Deadly for Native communities, due to tribal and urban medical clinics lacking staffing, equipment, capacity, and funding; increased health and pre-existing medical condition risk factors faced in Native communities; and poverty, access to clean water and food scarcity. 
 
Our PPE partners have created an Emergency Pipeline including sourcing, purchasing and distributing PPE to medical facilities and communities most in need throughout Indian Country. Through our collective network of allies we have identified reputable and certified sources for securing masks from abroad and within the US. We have identified Native health facilities to receive large shipments of PPE. We are also working to facilitate tribes and health services to order directly from these same suppliers. 
 
We can’t do it without you. Help us raise $200,000 to provide Native American communities and medical staff personal protection equipment (PPE) including N95, KN95 and surgical masks, gowns, gloves, medical-grade disinfectant liquids and wipes, medical equipment, and other community needs. Every dollar we raise will go to those most in need. With our elders, the living bearers of our cultures and histories, at highest risk, Indian Country has so much at stake in this moment.

IEN is taking action to simultaneously respond to the emergency needs of our relatives for life-saving resources and to amplify the power of our peoples’ homegrown Indigeneity to help push forward a just recovery to a more equitable and sustainable future for our Indigenous communities and Nations. We are doing this in deep solidarity with movements of other oppressed brothers and sisters, and in defense of our Mother Earth and Father Sky upon which all life depends.
To donate by phone, please text IENCOVID to 44-321.

Small grants up to $2,000 are being extended to grassroots organizations and Indigenous brothers and sisters organizing mutual aid in their communities for three purposes: 1) Emergency purchase of essential provisions; 2) Support with transportation for essential needs, such as medical and groceries; and 3) Home business slowdowns in sales and other cash flow difficulties (“home business” is referring to things like quilting, regalia making, bead and quillwork, moccasin making, basket making, pottery, silversmithing, etc.)

Our Native nations and Indigenous communities are poorly prepared to handle the escalating COVID-19 pandemic, a situation aggravated by the chronic poverty in Indian Country caused by a long legacy of genocide, colonization, and racism. 

The urgency of basic healthcare access for our members is absolutely critical in the face of an extremely insufficient Indian Health Services infrastructure (there is an existing 40% vacancy of healthcare workers in Indian Country); and our communities' very high rates of pre-existing health conditions, extreme poverty, and widespread shortages of clean water, food, and adequate housing resulting from the continued failure of the U.S. government in fulfilling its trust responsibilities under treaty agreements. Prior to COVID-19, the U.S. Census already indicated that Native Americans have the highest poverty and unemployment rates in the United States, currently at 25% and which will now be exacerbated.

Please join us in mobilizing life-saving resources to our relatives as quickly as possible!

IEN is able to distribute 100% of your donation to those in need because we have philanthropic partners that have awarded grants that will cover all of our administrative costs to do so. 
Please donate now! 
In addition to responding to the emergency needs of our network, you can trust that IEN continues to push forward its long-term vision to bring about an equitable Indigenous Just Transition rooted in tribal sovereignty and self-determination. 
Born of Hope, Courage, and Common Vision, we will persist and we will overcome this together.
